Repository of custom CSS styles for the Vikunja to-app

Vikunja (https://vikunja.io/) is an open-source to-do app by kolaente (founder and pricipal developer of VIkunja).
The app is under development so there are many more important things to do than cosmetics. Still, since my eyes demand "dark mode" whenever possible, I've decided to build one myself.

It will not interfere at all with Vikunja code since it's designed to be injected directly in the browser (several extensions allow this). Please note that this is an official mod and therefore not tied to the main development of Vikunja, so it may break sometimes. I'll do as much as possible to keep it always updated.
