##  VIKUNJA OVERRIDE STYLES
VikunjaDark.css - version 1.0 - 2021-03-20

##  # 1. INTRO
Vikunja (https://vikunja.io/) is an open-source, self-hosted, cross-platform, to-do list application licenced under GPLv3, developed by The Vikuja Authors (so they say!)

The Vikunja Authors are having a lot of effort making this application feature-rich so styling issues are obviously less important at this time.

I find Vikunja incredibly useful already but my eyes demand a dark mode and my huge lists demand a more compact layout â€“ that's why I made stylesheet to accomplished it.

CAUTION: this is an UNOFICIAL mod, not related with Vikunja Authors: this means it may break sometimes, altought I'll try to make it always compatible with the more recent versions of Vikunja.

NOTE: this is a WIP: may have bugs, please report them.

### 2. USAGE
Simply overlay this CSS file over the rendered app. This can be done with a lot of browser extensions (look for 'css inject', 'css override', etc).

I have separated the styles in three files which can be used together or independently to achive different Vikunja looks (eg. you prefer a light theme but want more items on the screen? Just overaly the 'compact' rules). The three files are:

'VikunjaDark.css' - overlaying this will bring dark colors to Vikunja (good for the eyes);

'VikunjaCompact.css' - overlaying this will make the interface more compact (good for people with LOTS of tasks);

'VikunjaStylized.css' - overlaying this will make opinionated changes like removing shadows and borders or changing alignments (good for clean-style-freaks like me);

ENJOY! And a big THANK YOU to Vikunja Authors for this wonderful piece of software.
